# Generative-AI-project-
(Work in progress)
Project status: Incomplete 

Automated Personalized content creation tool that integrates existing AI tools into a single multimodal AI platform, and generates content in storytelling mode. In essence, making use of APIs available for tools such as text generating AI like ChatGPT, image generators like DALL-E, audio generator tools, and AI video generating tool, and combining them together to make a single web app that can be used as a storytelling platform ( for example, user inputs a prompt for a story, and then the app generates the story text, relevant images, audio for background music relevant to context, as well as a demo video.
This started as PBL project in college in 2nd year, and then continued as a proper standalone project that I built from scratch.
Additional things to do in future: instead of relying on APIs from available AI tools, why not build your own version of text-generating AI? So eventually, I will try to create my own mini-GPT for text generator,or a primitive version of image generating AI, using Tensorflow, and Youtube tutorials ( Andrej Karpathy, Sentdex)

# Generative-AI-project-
Undergraduate project
(Work in progress)
Project status: Incomplete 
This mostly involves everything I aim to do individually on my own in pursuit of learning more about AI and doing projects on it on my own, the hackathon serves only as a direction for my motives. I plan to seek no external help, and do everything on my own for the code implementation required, because I want to self-study.
(coincidentally our Hackathon topic matched the PBL topic we had chosen a year ago, so that inspired me to continue with the idea full-fledged)

Smart India Hackathon 2023 

Problem statment: Text to Video of various PIB Press Releases using Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning / Generative Adversarial Networks in English and 13 Regional Languages viz. Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Odia, Bengali, Assamese and Manipuri.

Description : 

Press Releases of the Press Information Bureau are in the form of text. The attention span of the user is reducing by the year, So to engage with the user in a meaningful way, the Press Releases need to be provided in a video format. Software should be designed in such a format to generate the videos automatically from the Press Releases published. The images and clips used for generating the video should be copyright free. There should be a provision to store a pool of images and clips for generating the video. The generated video should be vetted by the concerned PIB officer before publishing. Software should be designed in such a format to generate the videos automatically from the Press Releases published. The images and clips used for generating the video should be copyright-free and authentic sources. There should be a provision to store a pool of images and clips for generating the video. The generated video should be vetted by the concerned PIB officer before publishing. The software also includes a provision to send the notification to the concerned PIB officer for approval. After approval, the software should have the feature of auto-uploading on the concerned social media sites.

PBL project(ideation phase of overall project)(second year)(when our idea was born)

Automated Personalized content creation tool that integrates existing AI tools into a single multimodal AI platform, and generates content in storytelling mode. In essence, making use of APIs available for tools such as text generating AI like ChatGPT, image generators like DALL-E, audio generator tools, and AI video generating tool, and combining them together to make a single web app that can be used as a storytelling platform ( for example, user inputs a prompt for a story, and then the app generates the story text, relevant images, audio for background music relevant to context, as well as a demo video.
This started as PBL project in college in 2nd year.
Additional things to do in future: instead of relying on APIs from available AI tools, why not build your own version of text-generating AI? So eventually, I will try to create my own mini-GPT for text generator,or a primitive version of image generating AI, using Tensorflow, and Youtube tutorials ( Andrej Karpathy, Sentdex)
